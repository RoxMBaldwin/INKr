# INKr

INKr? :

INKr's primary function is to instill creativity and light-hearted fun while interacting with comic book characters new and known to the user.  An "inker" is a creative role within the creation of a comic book and they ink over the pencils that the penciler drew. INKr will give users the opportunity to creatively interact with comic book characters and act as temporary "inkers" by adding color and form with the original image as a focal point. I kept my design very clean and simple in order to be aesthetically pleasing with the UX focus being the Character Canvas because ,at a fundamental level, it is a drawing app and extraneous design would take away from the UX and connection to the project. Ultimately, my project connects users to nostalgic childhood icons and allow them to discover new characters while expressing themselves creatively.
